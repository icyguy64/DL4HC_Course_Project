This folder contains the trained BERT models, LR/CNN/BiGRU/CAML models as well as the word2vec embeddings

As the files are too large for GitHub, I have uploaded the model files over at Google Drive. Interested readers can download them at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uNkqgA6PP6_zAvM_2jfpTcpFadUS_hMU?usp=sharing
